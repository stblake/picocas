/* Context system for PicoCAS.
 *
 * A context is a namespace identified by a string ending in a backtick, e.g.
 * "Global`" or "MyPackage`Private`". Every symbol conceptually lives in a
 * context, addressed as "context`name".
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 * - $Context holds the current context string; new unqualified symbols are
 *   created in it.
 * - $ContextPath is an ordered list of contexts consulted when resolving a
 *   bare identifier that has not yet been seen.
 * - For backward compatibility with existing code that stores builtins under
 *   bare names (e.g. "Plus"), bare names that already resolve to an existing
 *   builtin are left bare; they are treated as implicitly belonging to
 *   "System`".

 *     "`Private`f"  in context "foo`"  becomes "foo`Private`f".
 *  3. Names containing a backtick elsewhere are absolute. "System`X" is
 *     canonicalized to bare "X" (since builtins are stored under bare names).
 *  4. Otherwise (bare identifier):
 *     a. Search each prefix in { $Context } U $ContextPath. If prefix+name
 *        already exists in the symbol table, return that full name.
