/* PicoCAS — Rationalize.
 *
 * Converts inexact (Real / MPFR) numbers to nearby rationals, mirroring
 * Mathematica's Rationalize:
 *
 *   Rationalize[x]      → x converted to a nearby rational with small
 *                         denominator, but only if there is one within
 *                         |p/q − x| < 10^-4 / q^2; otherwise x is returned
 *                         unchanged.
 *   Rationalize[x, dx]  → the rational with the smallest denominator that
 *                         lies within dx of x (uses the standard "simplest
 *                         rational in interval" continued-fraction search).
 *   Rationalize[x, 0]   → forces conversion of any inexact x to rational
 *                         form, using a tolerance derived from the input's
 *                         precision (≈ ½·ulp).
 *
 * Threading:
 *   Rationalize maps over the internal structure of its argument:
 *     Rationalize[a + b]      ≡ Rationalize[a] + Rationalize[b]
 *     Rationalize[Complex[a,b]] ≡ Complex[Rationalize[a], Rationalize[b]]
 *   so e.g. Rationalize[1.2 + 6.7 x] becomes 6/5 + (67 x)/10.
 *
 * Two entry points are exposed: an `Expr*`-level builtin used by the
 * evaluator, and a lower-level `internal_rationalize_double` used by other
 * algorithms (Simplify, NSolve helpers, …) that already hold a `double`.

 *   - Complex[re, im] is recursed into componentwise.
 *   - Integers, Rationals, Symbols are returned unchanged.
 *   - Other compound expressions: in TOLERANCE / ZERO modes, a fully
 *     numeric subexpression (per NumericQ) is first numericalised then
 *     rationalised — so `Rationalize[Sqrt[2], 0.01]` returns 99/70.
 *     Otherwise the function is rebuilt with each argument recursively
 *     rationalised, so `Rationalize[a + 1.5 x]` becomes `a + (3 x)/2`.

 *   1. Per inexact leaf we try the convergent-bound algorithm first
 *      (Rationalize's no-tolerance form) — that recovers `1/9.` as
 *      `1/9` rather than the bit-exact `562949953421312/...`. Only
 *      when no convergent fits the bound do we fall back to the
 *      ½-ulp algorithm so the result is always a rational.
 *   2. Symbolic constants (Pi, E, ...) are NOT rationalised — they
 *      stay symbolic so e.g. `Together[Pi/x + 1.5]` keeps Pi exact and
 *      only converts the 1.5.
 *
 * The descent threads over compound expressions; Hold-forms are passed
 * through. Returned Expr is freshly allocated; `e` is read but not
 * consumed. */

 * contains an inexact leaf, build a clone with each argument

 * inexact-in / inexact-out semantics consistent with Mathematica.
 *
 * Idiomatic use at the top of a builtin:
 *
 *   if (internal_args_contain_inexact(res))
 *       return internal_rationalize_then_numericalize(res, builtin_xxx);
 *
 * Recursion bottoms out cleanly: the cloned `res` no longer contains
 * inexact leaves, so the inner `core(clone)` call falls through this
 * guard and runs the exact-arithmetic path.
 *
 * Ownership: matches the in-tree builtin convention — the evaluator
 * frees `res` after a non-NULL return, so this helper never touches
 * it. The internally-built clone is always freed by this helper. If
 * `core` returns NULL (cannot evaluate even the rationalised input),
 * the helper returns NULL too and the evaluator keeps the original
 * `res` unevaluated. */
